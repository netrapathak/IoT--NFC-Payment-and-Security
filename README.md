# IoT--NFC-Payment-and-Security
Project implemented as part of "Internet of Things" course.

In this project, me along with my teammates developed an android application using built-in NFC tag of the mobile phone to connect to Arduino using an NFC reader and receive verification details.
The payable amount entered through an actuator was checked with the server database connected to the internet through a WiFi module, and the transaction success message was displayed on client end.

Hardware components used: Arduino UNO, Arduino MEGA, NFC Reader, LCD Display, Wi-fi Module, etc.
